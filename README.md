**Scene 1:**
The corridors of the school buzzed with life during recess. Students laughed, chattered, and shared snacks with their friends and partners. It was a vibrant scene, but inside one of the classrooms, a starkly different atmosphere prevailed.  

ARA, a boy with pitch-black skin that seemed to absorb the light around him, sat alone at the first bench near the door. His posture was upright, and his gaze was focused on the tiffin box in front of him. ARA was known for his strict principles, which made him an outlier among his peers. Silently, he ate his meal, exuding a calm, impenetrable aura, unaffected by the noise outside.  

The door to the classroom creaked open, and Vergil entered. His walk was brisk, his excitement apparent in the way he carried himself, but his face betrayed none of it. Vergil was the kind of guy perpetually glued to Discord, his emotional expressions eroded by the constant digital immersion. His blank, expressionless face moved through the classroom as he looked for his friends, Ay and JCB.  

However, just as he reached the podium, something caught his attention in his peripheral vision—a sight that made his steps falter.  

It was *her*.  

Namami.  

The most beautiful girl he had ever seen. With unnaturally white skin that almost glowed, Namami was an enigma. She was the unopened Pandora's box, her cheerful energy a magnet for everyone around her. But what made Vergil’s chest tighten was not just her presence—it was where she was.  

Namami sat behind ARA, leaning forward to chat animatedly with him. Her voice was like bells chiming, cheerful and warm. ARA, true to his nature, barely responded, his focus still on his tiffin, yet he did not seem to mind her presence.  

Vergil’s chest clenched. He froze for a moment, then ducked behind the podium to conceal himself. Kneeling there, he began to cry silently—no sound, no tears, just the overwhelming weight of unspoken emotions.  

As Vergil sobbed silently, Namami leaned closer to ARA, teasing him playfully. Her laughter filled the room like sunlight breaking through clouds.  

“Stop...” ARA finally said, his voice a low murmur. He reached out to gently place a hand over her mouth to quiet her.  

But Namami, ever the trickster, leaned forward swiftly, catching him off guard. Their lips brushed in an accidental, fleeting kiss. Her unnaturally white skin seemed to blend with ARA’s dark tone in a striking contrast—like Yin and Yang intertwined for a brief, electrifying moment.  

Vergil, still hidden, saw everything. His body stiffened as his silent sobs grew heavier. He tried to muffle his strangled breaths as his heart shattered.  

The bell rang, breaking the moment like a sudden clap of thunder. Namami pulled away, her face alight with a mischievous smile.  

“Bye-bye, ARA!” she chirped, skipping out of the classroom without a second glance.  

As she disappeared into the crowded hallway, Ay and JCB entered the room. They froze upon seeing Vergil crouched behind the podium, his shoulders trembling.  

“Vergil?” Ay called, concern lacing his voice.  

But Vergil couldn’t answer. The image of Namami’s radiant smile as she left ARA lingered in his mind, searing his heart with an unspoken pain.
